# macron-agenda

 Looking at what the French president has been up to. 

 Submission for Data Studio Project 4. 

## The Data 

In elysee_scrape.ipynb I scrape every official event that is listed on the [official Elys√©e Agenda](https://www.elysee.fr/agenda) since May 2017, using BeautifulSoup. The output is saved to **agenda.csv**.

## Analysis 

I used regular expressions to find mentions of people and countries. I used R, Rawgraphs and Adobe Illustrator (aand ai2html) to create the visuals.
